The throughput and performance surpassed the native Golang net library as the connection pool is rewritten based on the Epoll model that could guarantee a load of more than 600,000 users to be online simultaneously.<br>\n‚Ä¢ The RTM service consisted of 9 microservices, provided Chat Room, Bullet Chat, Customer Support Live Chat, and other capabilities for multiple business projects that could quickly access this service.\r\n‚Ä¢ As the lead engineer for this project, I redesigned the overall architecture of the RTM Services as I pushed the entire system transfer to Kubernetes. The original problem of inability to Autoscaling was resolved and provided the ability to Gracefully-Shutdown then improved the system availability.</p>\n<h3>Achievements</h3>\n<p>‚Ä¢ Built-in Message Sequence model, ACK (Acknowledgement) mechanism and retry strategy ensure the uniqueness, sequence, and more than 98% arrival rate of messages.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¢ Implemented gateway discovery and registration mechanism, conquered the instability of the gateway during Autoscaling for stable execution of message delivery.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¢ Built detailed monitoring dashboards using Prometheus and Grafana to observe message arrival rate, user load, delivery delay, QPS of various APIs, etc.\r\n‚Ä¢ Worked with DevOps engineers to develop the CI/CD process and different environment isolation.</p>","frontmatter":{"listName":"üîç /IM-Service","nameOfClass":"projects-items","popupGithubLink":null,"popupImageAlt":null,"popupImageSrc":null,"popupLiveLink":null,"techIcons":["amazonecs","go","socketdotio","docker","kubernetes","istio","redis","grafana","prometheus","googlecloud","githubactions"],"title":"Golang & Istio IM Microservices Architecture ","video":"false"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"projects/im-service"}},
